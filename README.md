## API ROUTES
| Routes            | Methods  |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| /api/users/       | GET/POST/PUT/DELET |
| /api/products/    | GET/POST |

| /api/orders/      | GET/POST |

## Data Models
* For the product data model I have extracted the Product type and the product Brand from the product and created a new collection for them. The reason it's done like this is because, our website fetches the product type and the product brand every time it is run. Therefore, I didn't want to go through each product every time to return the product type and brand, rather I created a collection which contains the product type an product brand with their own unique ID, and return them when it was requested
